# SwasthVault üè•
**Centralized Medical History Management System**

A critical project that can transform public health infrastructure by providing unified, secure, and interoperable medical records for every citizen.

## üîë Core Objectives

- **Unified Health Record**: Maintain every citizen's complete medical history‚Äîfrom allergies, prescriptions, diagnostics, surgeries to mental health
- **Interoperability**: Allow any verified doctor/hospital across the country to access and update patient records
- **Continuity of Care**: Enable seamless transfer of patient data between healthcare providers
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Only patients and authorized professionals can access/update records
- **Tamper-proof History**: Every update is timestamped and logged; past records cannot be deleted‚Äîonly added with justification
- **Emergency Access**: Paramedics/doctors can access critical medical info instantly with biometric or QR verification

## üß© Key Features

### Patient Management
- **Aadhaar/UID Integration**: Link each record with verified national ID
- **Health Timeline View**: Scrollable timeline of patient's entire medical journey
- **Emergency Profile**: Quick access to critical info (blood group, allergies, chronic conditions)

### Healthcare Provider Features
- **Doctor Verification System**: Digital signatures for all medical updates
- **Appointment & Referral History**: Complete chain of consultations and diagnoses
- **Prescription & Medication Logs**: Track medications, dosage, and effects
- **Lab Reports & Scans**: DICOM/PDF uploads with annotations
- **Vaccination Records**: Including COVID-19 and other immunization data

### Security & Access
- **Offline Access Mode**: Limited data via encrypted QR code
- **Audit Logs**: Full traceability of data access and modifications
- **Consent-Based Access**: Third-party access (insurance, research) with patient consent

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Required for all healthcare providers
- **Biometric Authentication**: For emergency access scenarios
- **HIPAA + Indian Health Data Protection Compliant**
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permission levels for different user types

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
- RESTful API with JWT authentication
- MongoDB for flexible medical data storage
- Redis for session management and caching
- Blockchain integration for tamper-proof audit trails

### Frontend (React.js)
- Responsive web application
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- Real-time updates with WebSocket
- Offline-first architecture

### Security Layer
- OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect
- AES-256 encryption
- Digital signatures with PKI
- Biometric integration APIs
